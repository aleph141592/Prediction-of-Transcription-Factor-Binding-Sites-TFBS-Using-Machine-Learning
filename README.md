# Prediction-of-Transcription-Factor-Binding-Sites-TFBS-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) using machine learning. We processed FASTA files from two databases (collecTF and RegulonDB), trained both Random Forest and SVM models, and found that SVM performed better in classification accuracy.
